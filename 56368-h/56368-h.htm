<p class="center">OF NEW-YORK.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:—Whatever may be the particular
estimate set upon the intellectual character of the American
aborigines, or the decision had on the perplexing question of their
remote origin, or their actual and varying condition, few will dispute
the large share of interest which they have in the public mind. And
it is a species of interest which, I think we shall perceive, will be
found to assume a higher and more imaginative cast, connected with the
advancing state of letters and the fine arts, as we recede from the
historical era, when these tribes were confessedly the lords and rulers
of the land.</p>

<p>Their name and semblance are, in truth, infiltrated, if I may use a
chemical phrase, into the very elements of the American landscape,
which can hardly ever be contemplated without bringing out from the
latent depths of the imagination, the image of the lithe Indian, with
his Robin Hood arms and his picturesque costume. The policy which
an enlightened government and people ought to pursue towards them,
at all times, is a question that chiefly concerns the statesman and
the philanthropist. But there are a hundred subordinate questions
which come home for decision to the bosoms of all readers and
thinkers, travellers and writers, to whom the race itself, viewed as
a broken link in the ethnological chain, is a fruitful theme, both
for retrospection and for actual observation. I have indeed, myself,
participated largely in this field of observation, and may with truth
affirm, that I return to society, after completing a period of but
little short of four and twenty years in their territories.</p>

<p>How far the interest of these reminiscences of a noble race are
realized, or communicated in the following tale, I cannot pretend
to predict. But if I may rely on the American press, and it is an
authority which, in this instance, is sustained abroad, there are
few persons who are so well qualified to judge of success in this
particular as yourself. This consideration would plead a justification
for the liberty I take, of addressing the present sketch to you; but it
is a liberty which I should hardly venture on, were I not,</p>

<p class="author">Very truly yours,<br /><span class="smcap">The Author</span>.</p>

<p>The treaty of Ghent, concluded in the autumn of 1814, terminated the
contest then existing between the United States and Great Britain,
although it was not promulgated in time to arrest one of the severest
battles of the war. In this contest, as in all prior ones of a general
character, subsequent to the settlement of European nations in the new
world, the native tribes were deeply involved. Indeed, it was under the
influence of an extraordinary prophetic delusion, that it may be said
to have commenced, on their part, on the plains of Tippecanoe.</p>

<p>If the opening of this renewed struggle for supremacy by the aborigines
in 1811, on the banks of the Wabash, had the effect to bring on the
stage of action a noted warrior, in the person of Tecumthe,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
who certainly has had few equals as a military and political leader,
since the era of the prior stand made by the American tribes under
Pontiac; its onward events, and its, to them, disastrous close, drew
into prominent notice a scarcely less remarkable, and in some traits
superior, character, under the name of Tuscaloosa, or the Black
Warrior. This man, from his personal courage, skill, and activity,
absorbed the full confidence of his tribe; and to him was, in effect,
committed the cause of the Indian war in the south, until the date of
his voluntary personal surrender to the American commander, after the
power of his nation had been crushed in a series of sanguinary battles,
and a price set upon his head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the race of the Muscogees, who, under the popular name of
Creeks, opposed the most strenuous opposition to the arms of the United
States. This nation, in its numerous clans and subdivisions, were, at
the period, strong in their numbers, and confident in their strength.
These clans, influenced and misled by foreign counsel, were seated
in their original vallies, forests, and fastnesses, in the remoter
slopes and spurs of the Southern Alleghanies, stretching towards the
gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi, but were found to have their chief
point of military supply in Florida, then under the dominion of Spain,
into which the operations of the war were eventually and necessarily
transferred. It was in this manner that the Seminoles, who have since
made so protracted a stand, first drew upon themselves the force of the
American arms.</p>

<p>The present tale, in which fiction builds itself upon these general
facts, turns upon the contest of the Muscogees, their exertions, their
discomfitures, and their final fall. It opens at a distant point, many
degrees towards the north, within a short period after the close of
the Creek war. It occupies two days and two nights in its action. The
idea here brought forward of uniting or intermingling the dramatic,
with the narrative and descriptive, is believed to be well adapted to
topics of this character, in which the natural bent of the natives
for declamation and mystic romance may be indulged, while the time
of the action, it is conceived, may be thereby curtailed, and verbal
description retrenched. The measure is thought to be not ill adapted
to the Indian mode of enunciation. Nothing is more characteristic of
their harangues and public speeches, than that vehement, yet broken and
continued strain of utterance, which would be subject to the charge of
monotony, were it not varied by an extraordinary compass in the stress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of voice, broken by the repetition of high and low accent, and often
terminated with an exclamatory vigor, which is sometimes startling.
It is not the less in accordance with these traits, that nearly every
initial syllable of the measure chosen, is under accent. This at least
may be affirmed, that it imparts a movement to the narrative, which, at
the same time that it obviates languor, favors that repetitious rhythm,
or pseudo-parallelism, which so strongly marks their highly compound
lexicography.</p>

<p>Of the theme itself, nothing further is requisite to be said. The
tale was written, as it now stands, in 1826, with a few exceptions of
earlier date; and it may be added, that it was among the <i>agremens</i>
of the writer’s seclusion, while he was living in a public capacity,
within the impressive scenes, and among the manly tribes, in the lake
region described. That its publication should have been deferred until
the author had seen cause to resume the original orthography of the
initial syllable of his patronymic name, may render it proper further
to add, in this connection, that the change from School, and resumption
of Col, in the adjective syllable of the name, is in strict conformity
with family tradition, supported by recent observation in England. In
the latter country, however, the name is uniformly written Cal, however
it may be pronounced.</p>

<span class="i0">Dominion lost, skill baffled, power defied.</span>
<span class="i0">“Shades of my fathers!” thus his reverie ran,</span>
<span class="i0">“And shall the Red Man thus, in clouds decline,</span>
<span class="i0">With no memorial of his name or clan,</span>

<span class="i0">Who once were lords of the ascendant chase,</span>
<span class="i0">And swept the forests in their pristine bloom?</span>
<span class="i0">Brave were their hearts, and strong in sinewy strength</span>
<span class="i0">They drew the shaft that fell’d the stately deer,</span>
<span class="i0">Or spread the craven foeman at his length,</span>
<span class="i0">And triumphed in the battle’s wild career,</span>
<span class="i0">A wanderer of the woods—lord of the bow and spear.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Life’s path without a friend, and even death unkind?”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Doth human rectitude, in mind and heart,</span>
<span class="i0">The inward purposes of right and wrong</span>
<span class="i0">In human acts—so great a boon impart,</span>
<span class="i0">Or lead, by their neglect, to thraldom strong?</span>
<span class="i0">And can it be, ye messengers of air!</span>
<span class="i0">Who know the great high Spirit’s sov’reign will,</span>
<span class="i0">So vast a detriment he can prepare</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis wondrous all, and yet there are, I ween,</span>
<span class="i0">Some inward inklings of the Indian soul</span>
<span class="i0">That whisper to his mind of things unclean,</span>
<span class="i0">That taint his rites, and all his life control,</span>
<span class="i0">Leading the mind—whenever he would do</span>
<span class="i0">An evil act, or e’en the purpose form,</span>
<span class="i0">To that High Excellence beyond the view,</span>
<span class="i0">Who guides the sun and regulates the storm,</span>
<span class="i0">Dispensing winter winds, or summer breezes warm.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And is this conscience? So the white man tells,</span>
<span class="i0">Pointing to letters as the star-light kind,</span>
<span class="i0">That man’s own heart to man himself reveals,</span>
<span class="i0">And warms and renovates the wandering mind,</span>
<span class="i0">Impels the hand to drop the bloody blade,</span>
<span class="i0">And seek support from art’s more kindly cares,</span>
<span class="i0">Where genial fields invite the plough and spade,</span>

<span class="i0">And industry her golden wreath prepares,</span>
<span class="i0">And peace and joy and health, the household circle shares.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But why—and here my doubts and fears arise—</span>

<span class="i0">All bleared by acts that sunder friendship’s ties,</span>
<span class="i0">And overcast our atmosphere with storms;</span>
<span class="i0">Our lands despoiled by arts, we know not how,</span>
<span class="i0">Erst in the solemn council we convene,</span>

<span class="i0">“And whence—if we must acts by precepts try—</span>
<span class="i0">Whence all the new-found ills that mar our life,</span>

<span class="i0">That whelms our bands in most unseemly strife,</span>
<span class="i0">And oft our maddening blood, unruled before,</span>
<span class="i0">Stains with its purple tide our utmost lands?</span>
<span class="i0">Is this benignly meant? say, ye who teach—</span>

<span class="i0">In that dark hour of opening peril rife,</span>
<span class="i0">When late to arms the Southern war chiefs flew,</span>
<span class="i0">Albeit, misguided in their warlike ires,</span>
<span class="i0">By foreign counsels cast with cruel ken,</span>
<span class="i0">And war, through all their borders, lit his fires,</span>

<p class="neg-indent">[After the taking of Quebec, in 1759, the North
Western Indians adhered to their Gallic allies, and formed an extensive
combination for retaking all the posts west of the Alleghanies. Pontiac
was the leader and master-spirit of this confederacy, the seat of which
was Detroit. In 1763 he besieged the garrison at that place, with a
large confederated force of Indians, and defeated the besieged at the
battle of Bloody Bridge, killing their commander. The next year Gen.
Bradstreet advanced from Niagara to break up this confederacy, with
an army of 3000 men. The appeal may be supposed to be uttered on this occasion.] </p>

<span class="i0">And flaps his wings, with doubling sound, to tell his mate ’tis he.</span>

<span class="i0">The waters murmur softly then, and, as the trees grow bare,</span>
<span class="i0">Display their channels through the woods, and glitter doubly fair.</span>

The fall of Tuscaloosa, or the Black Warrior, is here symbolically
fixed on as the fall of the nation. This noted chief was not, however,
killed in battle; he came voluntarily to Gen. Jackson’s camp and
surrendered himself. He had disguised himself in mean clothes to
prevent his being shot down by the soldiers, as a price had been set
on his head. Hence the nobility of his declaration, on entering the
General’s tent—“I am Tuscaloosa.”</p></div>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
